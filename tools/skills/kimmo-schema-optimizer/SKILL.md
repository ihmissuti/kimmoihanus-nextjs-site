# Schema Optimizer for AI Visibility

Generate Schema.org markup optimized for both traditional search and AI/LLM discovery.

## When to Use

- User wants to add or improve Schema.org markup
- User asks about structured data for SEO or AI
- User wants to improve rich results or AI visibility
- User is building a devtool, SaaS, or content site

## Why Schema Matters for AI

LLMs and AI search engines extract structured data to:

- Understand what an entity IS (Organization, Product, SoftwareApplication)
- Extract relationships (author, creator, publisher)
- Identify key facts (pricing, features, ratings)
- Determine authority (sameAs links, official sources)

**Key insight**: Well-structured Schema.org data becomes part of what LLMs "know" about your brand.

## Schema Selection Guide

| Site Type         | Required Schemas                  | Recommended             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| SaaS/Devtool      | SoftwareApplication, Organization | FAQPage, HowTo          |
| Agency/Consultant | Organization, Person, Service     | FAQPage, Review         |
| Blog/Content      | Article, Person, Organization     | BreadcrumbList, FAQPage |
| Ecommerce         | Product, Organization             | Review, FAQPage, Offer  |
| Documentation     | TechArticle, HowTo                | SoftwareSourceCode      |

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Audit Current Schema

Check what exists:

```bash
# Using browser dev tools
# Or crawl with: curl -s URL | grep -o 'application/ld+json'
```

Or use Oxylabs MCP `ai_scraper` to extract existing markup.

### Step 2: Identify Gaps

For a devtool/SaaS, ensure these are present:

**Organization** (required)

- name, url, logo
- sameAs (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn)
- contactPoint

**SoftwareApplication** (required for devtools)

- name, applicationCategory
- operatingSystem, offers
- aggregateRating (if reviews exist)

**FAQPage** (highly recommended)

- Common questions from support/docs
- Increases chance of AI citing your answers

### Step 3: Generate Optimized Schema

## Schema Templates

### Organization (Base)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "[Company Name]",
  "url": "https://[domain].com",
  "logo": "https://[domain].com/logo.png",
  "description": "[One sentence value prop]",
  "sameAs": ["https://github.com/[org]", "https://twitter.com/[handle]", "https://linkedin.com/company/[company]"],
  "contactPoint": {
    "@type": "ContactPoint",
    "contactType": "customer support",
    "email": "support@[domain].com"
  }
}
```

### SoftwareApplication (DevTools)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "[Product Name]",
  "applicationCategory": "DeveloperApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Cross-platform",
  "description": "[What it does in one sentence]",
  "url": "https://[domain].com",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "[Company Name]"
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "description": "Free tier available"
  },
  "featureList": ["[Feature 1]", "[Feature 2]", "[Feature 3]"],
  "softwareRequirements": "Node.js 18+",
  "programmingLanguage": ["JavaScript", "TypeScript"]
}
```

### FAQPage (High AI Impact)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "[Common question from docs/support]",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "[Concise, factual answer]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### HowTo (For Tutorials/Guides)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "HowTo",
  "name": "How to [accomplish task] with [Product]",
  "description": "[Brief overview]",
  "step": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "name": "Install [Product]",
      "text": "npm install [package]"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "name": "Configure",
      "text": "[Configuration instructions]"
    }
  ],
  "tool": {
    "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
    "name": "[Product Name]"
  }
}
```

### Person (For Personal Brands)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "[Full Name]",
  "jobTitle": "[Role]",
  "url": "https://[personal-site].com",
  "sameAs": ["https://github.com/[username]", "https://twitter.com/[handle]", "https://linkedin.com/in/[profile]"],
  "knowsAbout": ["Generative Engine Optimization", "Technical Marketing", "[Other expertise]"],
  "worksFor": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "[Company]"
  }
}
```

## AI-Specific Optimization Tips

### 1. Be Explicit, Not Clever

```json
// ❌ Vague
"description": "The future of email"

// ✅ Clear
"description": "Email API for developers with React components and SMTP relay"
```

### 2. Include Relationships

```json
// Link entities together
"author": { "@type": "Organization", "name": "..." },
"publisher": { "@type": "Organization", "name": "..." },
"isPartOf": { "@type": "WebSite", "name": "..." }
```

### 3. Use sameAs for Authority

Link to all official presence:

- GitHub organization
- npm package
- Twitter/X account
- LinkedIn company page
- Wikipedia (if exists)

### 4. FAQPage for Common Queries

Convert your top support questions into FAQ schema. LLMs often surface FAQ content when answering related queries.

### 5. HowTo for Developer Workflows

Every "Getting Started" guide should have HowTo schema. This helps LLMs provide accurate implementation steps.

## Using External Tools

### Kimmo's Schema API (Recommended)

Call the public API for instant schema analysis and optimization:

```bash
curl -X POST https://kimmoihanus.com/api/schema-optimize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
```

Returns: existing schemas, page type detection, recommended schemas with templates, and optimized JSON-LD ready to implement.

## Validation

### Test with:

1. **Google Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. **Schema.org Validator**: https://validator.schema.org
3. **Manual LLM test**: Ask ChatGPT "What is [your product]?" and see if structured data appears in the response

## Output Template

```markdown
# Schema Optimization: [Domain]

## Current State

- Schemas found: [list]
- Missing critical schemas: [list]

## Recommended Implementation

### 1. Organization Schema (Priority: High)

[Generated JSON-LD]

### 2. [Product/Software] Schema (Priority: High)

[Generated JSON-LD]

### 3. FAQPage Schema (Priority: Medium)

[Generated JSON-LD]

## Implementation

Add to `<head>` section:
\`\`\`html

<script type="application/ld+json">
[Combined schema]
</script>

\`\`\`

## Expected Impact

- Rich results eligibility: [Yes/No]
- AI search visibility: [Improved/Maintained]
- Key facts extractable: [list what LLMs can now extract]
```
