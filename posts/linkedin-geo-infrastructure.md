**🚀 The next disruption won't come from better SEO. It'll come from "agentifying" boring infrastructure.**

Just saw Resend hit 1.4M weekly npm downloads, closing in on SendGrid's 1.65M.

A 7.4x growth in ONE year. Why?

Because AI agents don't read marketing pages. They read documentation, install packages, and make decisions.

We talk about GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) like it's just "SEO for ChatGPT."

It's not.

It's about becoming the default choice in the infrastructure layer where AI operates.

**Here's what's happening:**

In ecommerce, we're battling over schemas, UCP protocols, and agentic shopping.

But in devtools? The battle is already won or lost.

When someone builds their MVP with Cursor or Lovable, the AI suggests the email service, the auth provider, the database. These tools have MCP integrations. They're in the training data. They have clean, parseable docs.

**The math:**

Traditional funnel: Marketing → Landing page → Trial → Conversion
Agent funnel: Problem → AI suggestion → `npm install` → Subscription

One of these has 47 touchpoints. The other has 3.

**My take:**

Every "boring" infrastructure service is up for grabs:

- Email (Resend vs SendGrid)
- Auth (Clerk vs Auth0)
- Tunnels (ngrok vs alternatives)
- Payments (Stripe already won this)

The winners will be whoever:

1. Has the cleanest SDK and docs
2. Shows up in AI-generated code
3. Makes their MCP server dead simple

Big players can defend themselves—but only if they restructure their documentation, support channels, and even user-generated content for AI consumption.

**My challenge to you:**

Pick a "boring" service in your domain. Now ask: How would an AI agent evaluate this vs competitors?

That's your GEO strategy.

Go out there and disrupt a market.

# Beyond GEO: Why the Real AI Optimization Battle Is in Infrastructure

_How developer tools and "boring" services will be disrupted by agentic decision-making_

## The Numbers That Should Wake You Up

On December 18, 2025, Resend announced they hit 1 million users. But the more interesting number was buried in their changelog: **1.4 million weekly npm downloads**, up from 189,000 just twelve months earlier.

That's a 7.4x increase in one year.

Meanwhile, SendGrid—owned by Twilio, a $10B+ company—sits at 1.65 million weekly downloads. A 50-year-old-style enterprise with decades of market dominance is about to be overtaken by a startup that launched in 2023.

What happened? The answer lies in understanding that we're not just optimizing for search engines anymore—we're optimizing for the infrastructure layer where AI operates.

## GEO Is Not Just "SEO for ChatGPT"

There's been a lot of discussion about Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)—the practice of optimizing content so that AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity cite and recommend your products.

Most of this discussion focuses on content: How do we write blog posts that get cited? How do we structure FAQ pages? How do we appear in AI-generated summaries?

This is important. But it misses the bigger picture.

**GEO expands to a whole new level when businesses start to consider the "infrastructure" where AI operates to find and process information.**

In other words: it's not just about what the AI says about you. It's about what the AI _does_ with you.

## The Two Battlegrounds

### Battleground 1: Ecommerce and Discovery

In ecommerce, the GEO battle is about discoverability and shopping intent. We're seeing massive investments in:

- **Universal Cart Protocol (UCP)** and standardized schemas
- **Agentic shopping** where AI assistants browse, compare, and purchase
- **Structured product data** that AI can parse and recommend

This is a multi-step funnel. The AI discovers your product, evaluates it against competitors, perhaps asks clarifying questions, and eventually guides a purchase decision. There are many touchpoints, and each one is an optimization opportunity.

### Battleground 2: Developer Tools and Infrastructure

But there's another battleground that's moving even faster—and most people aren't paying attention.

**In developer tools and infrastructure, AI agents don't just recommend. They install.**

When a developer uses Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, or any AI-native coding assistant to build their time-tracking app or dating app MVP, something fascinating happens:

1. They describe what they need ("I need to send welcome emails")
2. The AI suggests a solution ("Let's use Resend for emails")
3. The AI writes the code, including the `npm install resend`
4. The developer runs it

That's it. No landing page. No marketing funnel. No sales call.

**The subscription happens at the speed of code generation.**

## Why Developer Tools Are the Canary in the Coal Mine

The expanding userbase of AI-native builders testing Lovable, Cursor, Replit, and similar tools is not a temporary trend. These tools are creating a new class of builders—people who can ship products without traditional programming skills.

And existing developers? They're adopting more sophisticated processes and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that let AI assistants interact directly with services.

Most web projects need:

- **Authentication** (Clerk, Auth0, Supabase Auth)
- **Email services** (Resend, SendGrid, Postmark)
- **Tunnels for local development** (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnels)
- **Database** (Supabase, PlanetScale, Neon)
- **Payments** (Stripe has already won this)
- **Deployment** (Vercel, Netlify, Railway)

This is the "boring stuff." And boring stuff is exactly where disruption happens.

## The Math of Agent-Driven Adoption

**Traditional B2B SaaS funnel:**
Marketing content → Google search → Landing page → Feature comparison → Free trial → Onboarding → Conversion

_Touchpoints: 15-50_
_Timeline: Days to weeks_

**Agent-driven funnel:**
Problem statement → AI recommendation → Package installation → API call works → Subscription

_Touchpoints: 3-5_
_Timeline: Minutes_

The economics are completely different. Customer acquisition cost approaches zero for the tools that AI assistants default to.

## What Makes a Tool "Agent-Friendly"?

Looking at Resend's success, and comparing it to tools that are winning in this new paradigm, patterns emerge:

### 1. SDK-First Design

The documentation leads with working code, not feature lists. The API is consistent and predictable. Type definitions are complete. Error messages are helpful.

### 2. Training Data Presence

The tool appears in GitHub repos, Stack Overflow answers, and technical blog posts that are in LLM training data. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle—AI recommends what it has seen work.

### 3. MCP Integration

Model Context Protocol servers let AI assistants interact directly with the service. Resend has one. Mailgun has one. The tools that don't? They're invisible to agents.

### 4. Parseable Documentation

Not just well-written docs—docs that are structured in ways that AI can extract and act on. Clear headings, code blocks, consistent formatting, explicit error handling.

### 5. Quick Time-to-Working

From `npm install` to "it works" in under 5 minutes. No complex onboarding flows. No mandatory GUI setup. API key, one function call, done.

## How Incumbents Can Defend Themselves

If you're an established player watching startups eat your market share, you're not helpless. But you need to act strategically:

### Restructure Your Documentation for AI Consumption

Your docs were written for humans browsing. Rewrite them for AI parsing. Structured data, clear hierarchies, consistent patterns.

### Open Your Data to LLM Crawlers

If you have valuable information—tutorials, use cases, integration guides—make it easily accessible and structured. Don't hide it behind logins.

### Invest in Support Channels That Generate Training Data

Public Discord servers, Stack Overflow engagement, GitHub discussions—these become training data. Private support tickets don't.

### Think About User-Generated Content

Developer blogs, YouTube tutorials, community projects—can you encourage and structure these to support GEO visibility?

### Build Official MCP Servers

If AI assistants can't interact with your service, you don't exist in the agent workflow.

## My Challenge to Builders and Investors

Here's my thesis: **Every "boring" infrastructure service is up for disruption by whoever becomes the AI-native default.**

The playbook is clear:

1. Pick a category where incumbents have complex SDKs, confusing docs, or legacy architectures
2. Build the cleanest possible developer experience
3. Make sure your solution appears in AI training data
4. Ship an MCP server
5. Be the answer when an AI assistant is asked "what should I use for X?"

**Think about it:**

- What's the Resend of logging?
- What's the Resend of feature flags?
- What's the Resend of CDNs?
- What's the Resend of error tracking?

Some of these battles are already being fought. Others haven't started yet.

## The Broader Implication

This isn't just about developer tools. It's a preview of what's coming to every B2B category.

When AI agents start making procurement decisions, vendor evaluations, and software recommendations across all business functions, the same dynamics will apply:

- Who has the cleanest integration?
- Who appears in the training data?
- Who can the agent actually interact with?

GEO isn't just about content optimization. It's about becoming part of the infrastructure where AI operates.

The companies that understand this will win the next decade.

The companies that don't will wonder why their market share is disappearing despite having "better features."
