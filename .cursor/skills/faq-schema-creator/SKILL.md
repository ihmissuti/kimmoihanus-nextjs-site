# FAQ Schema Creator

Create FAQ content and structured data that AI search engines can easily extract, understand, and cite in their answers.

## Why FAQs Matter for GEO

FAQs are one of the most effective content formats for AI search visibility:

1. **Question-answer format** - Matches how users query AI assistants
2. **Highly extractable** - Each Q&A can be quoted standalone
3. **Schema support** - FAQPage schema helps AI parse content
4. **Multiple keywords** - Each question targets different search intents
5. **Higher citation rates** - Brands using FAQ schema see up to 35% higher extractability

## FAQ Content Structure

### Writing Effective Questions

**Good questions:**

- Start with "What", "How", "Why", "When", "Can", "Does"
- Match actual user search queries
- Are specific enough to have clear answers
- Include relevant keywords naturally

**Examples:**

```markdown
# Good

What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?
How does GEO differ from traditional SEO?
How often should I update content for AI search?
What are the key metrics for measuring GEO success?

# Bad (too vague or not searchable)

Tell me about optimization
What's the deal with AI?
Can you explain more?
More info please
```

### Writing Effective Answers

Follow these guidelines for AI-friendly answers:

1. **Answer immediately** - First sentence should directly answer the question
2. **Keep it concise** - 40-200 words per answer
3. **Make it standalone** - Each answer should make sense without context
4. **Include key terms** - Echo question keywords in the answer
5. **Be specific** - Use concrete details, numbers, examples

**Answer template:**

```markdown
### [Question]?

[Direct answer in 1-2 sentences]. [Supporting detail or context].
[Example or specific recommendation if relevant].
```

**Example:**

```markdown
### What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing
content to be discovered and cited by AI search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Google AI Mode. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses
on search rankings, GEO focuses on brand visibility, citation rate,
and share of voice inside AI-generated answers.
