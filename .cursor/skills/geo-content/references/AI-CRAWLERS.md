# How AI Crawlers Read Your Site

## The Three Layers of AI Search

### Layer 1: Training Data (Slowest)

Where LLMs learn about your brand during their training process. Getting into the base training data of major LLMs can take months.

### Layer 2: High-Volume AI Search (Speed Depends on SEO)

Includes free ChatGPT, Google's AI Overviews. This layer is only as fast as your SEO is good. Strong domain authority and quality content = faster visibility.

### Layer 3: Agentic AI (Real-Time & Fast)

Pro tools like Perplexity Pro, ChatGPT Research and Shopping, Claude Desktop with MCPs actually scrape and read your pages in real-time.

## Preparing for the Agentic Era

### 2. Optimize robots.txt

Make intentional decisions about which AI crawlers to welcome.

### 3. Monitor Bot Traffic

Check server logs to understand which AI agents visit and how often.

### 4. Structure Product Data

For e-commerce: accurate pricing, specifications, availability, and reviews in structured formats.

### 5. Build Strong SEO Foundations

High-volume AI Search depends on your SEO strength. Domain authority + quality content = faster AI visibility.

### 6. Prepare for Real-Time Agentic Interactions

Ensure your site can handle increased bot traffic with clean heading hierarchies, semantic HTML, and machine-readable formats.
