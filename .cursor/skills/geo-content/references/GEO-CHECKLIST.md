## GEO in One Glance

- **What GEO is**: Generative Engine Optimization is the process of making your brand visible and citable inside AI generated answers across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews and AI Mode, and other assistants.
- **What it builds on**: GEO sits on top of SEO. Strong technical SEO, solid content and authority signals are still required, then you add structures that help AI engines parse, trust and reuse your pages.
- **What success looks like**: When users ask buying or research questions about your category, AI assistants regularly cite your brand, your URLs, or your original studies as part of the answer.
- **Where it happens**: GEO operates across three layers of AI Search, from slow training data to high volume AI surfaces and fast real time agents that scrape pages under tight time budgets.
- **How you measure it**: Core GEO KPIs are AI Brand Visibility, citation rate, AI Share of Voice against competitors, and how human and bot traffic from AI platforms converts compared to other channels.

## 10-Step GEO Checklist

### 1. Run an AI Search visibility audit

Test real prompts in ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Copilot and DeepSeek. Log which brands are mentioned, how your company is described, and where citations come from.

### 2. Map prompts to intent and funnel stages

Group prompts by awareness, consideration and decision. Decide which questions you must own, then connect each to one or more pages on your site.

### 3. Create deep, authoritative cornerstone content

Publish guides that fully answer the key questions with clear definitions, examples, real data and expert quotes so AIs can trust and reuse your material.

### 4. Optimize for extractability and the 0.4 second speed signal

Front load answers, use question style H2s, short paragraphs, lists and tables, and keep first contentful paint around 0.4 seconds on priority pages so real time agents do not abandon your site.

### 5. Implement schema and clean metadata

Add JSON LD for Article, FAQPage, HowTo, Product and Organization. Keep titles, meta descriptions, Open Graph tags and knowledge graph entities consistent across your properties.

### 6. Build a web wide footprint

Strengthen your presence on Wikipedia or Wikidata, key directories and review sites, LinkedIn Pulse, Reddit and industry forums so AIs see multiple trusted entry points into your brand.

### 7. Grow brand authority and engagement

Maintain a steady cadence of high quality content, PR, thought leadership and reviews. Encourage discussion and references that create independent signals of trust.

### 8. Track GEO metrics, not only traffic

Monitor Brand Visibility, citation rate, AI Share of Voice, human versus bot traffic and referral visits from AI surfaces so you can see where you truly appear in answers.

### 9. Refresh high value pages every 60 to 90 days

Update statistics, examples and product details, add new internal links and keep visible change logs so AI engines and users see that core assets are maintained.

### 10. Avoid common GEO mistakes

Do not rely on thin content, keyword stuffing, one channel distribution, or Google only metrics. Blend SEO and GEO, and keep monitoring prompts, competitors and new AI surfaces.

## Key Insights

### The 0.4s Speed Signal

Fast-loading pages are 3x more likely to be cited by ChatGPT. Maintaining high technical performance ensures real-time agentic AI crawlers don't abandon your site.

### Third-Party Authority

Brands are 6.5x more likely to be cited through third-party sources like Wikipedia, Reddit, and industry forums than through their own domains, making a web-wide footprint essential.

### New KPIs

Success in 2026 is measured by AI Share of Voice and citation rates rather than traditional clicks, as 93% of AI search sessions now end without a click.

### Think in Extractable "Nodes"

Write in clear, modular blocks rather than long, unstructured pages. Use JSON-LD schema (FAQ, HowTo, Article) to help AI engines easily parse and reuse your data.
