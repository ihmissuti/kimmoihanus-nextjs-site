# GEO Checklist Auditor

Audit web pages against the comprehensive GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) best practices checklist to ensure optimal visibility in AI search engines.

## Why This Audit Matters

- AI-sourced visitors convert at 27% vs 2.1% from traditional search (12x improvement)
- 60% of queries now end in zero-click answers
- Only 16% of brands systematically track AI search performance
- Brands with 70%+ compliance on GEO checklists see measurably higher citation rates

## The 12-Step GEO Audit Checklist

Use this checklist as a comprehensive pass before publishing or updating any high-value page.

### 1. AI Search Visibility Baseline

**What to check:**

- Has the page topic been tested in AI assistants?
- Which brands currently appear for related queries?
- What sources are being cited?

**Audit actions:**

- [ ] Test 3-5 relevant prompts in ChatGPT
- [ ] Test same prompts in Perplexity
- [ ] Test in Google AI Mode if available
- [ ] Document which competitors are mentioned
- [ ] Note which sources are cited

**Test query patterns:**

```
"What are the best [your category]?"
"How does [your product type] work?"
"[Your product] vs [competitor] comparison"
"What companies offer [your service]?"
```

### 2. Business KPI Alignment

**What to check:**

- Are GEO objectives connected to revenue metrics?
- Can improvements be measured against business outcomes?

**Audit questions:**

- [ ] Tracking in place to measure impact
- [ ] Page targets specific customer journey stage

### 3. Technical Infrastructure

**What to check:**
