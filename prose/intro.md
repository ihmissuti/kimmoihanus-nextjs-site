I'm Kimmo Ihanus, a technical founder and AI expert with 15+ years of experience in AI, marketing, and data. Based in Helsinki, Finland.

- Co-founder & CTO of [Superlines](https://www.superlines.io) - the leading AI Search Analytics platform helping brands optimize their visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and other AI platforms. Featured in [Helsingin Sanomat](https://www.hs.fi/visio/art-2000011333578.html) and [Markkinointiuutiset](https://www.markkinointiuutiset.fi/artikkelit/suomalainen-markkinoijille-suunnattu-tekoaly-startup-hamuaa-vauhdilla-globaaleille-markkinoille).

- Among the first teams in the Nordics to gain access to OpenAI's GPT-3 in 2020, well before most realized how transformative AI would become.

- Selected for Google's AI Startup Program, receiving technical support and cloud credits.

- Previously Growth Lead at [Cronvall](https://www.cronvall.com), growth marketer at Slush 100 winner [Yousician](https://www.yousician.com), and Senior Growth Hacker at [Avaus](https://www.avaus.com).

- Builder of experimental tech products like [pointNG](https://pointng.io) (privacy-first location detection using edge ML), [Hacker-AI](https://hacker-ai.com) (A/B test your HackerNews titles before publishing), and [ConsoleChat](https://consolechat.io) (underground chat in the browser console).

I've been obsessed with AI and algorithms my entire career. Marketing is one of the best fields to use AI: lots of data and complex problems, many of which are impossible for humans to solve.
