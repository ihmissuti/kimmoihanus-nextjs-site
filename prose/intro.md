I'm Kimmo Ihanus, a technical founder and AI expert with 15+ years of experience in AI, marketing, and data. Based in Helsinki, Finland.

- Co-founder & CTO of [Superlines](https://www.superlines.io) - the leading AI Search Analytics platform helping brands optimize their visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and other AI platforms. Featured in [Helsingin Sanomat](https://www.hs.fi/visio/art-2000011333578.html), [Talouselämä](https://www.talouselama.fi/uutiset/a/6f5337ec-37d7-4aef-ab4b-b6d60e54bab0), and [Markkinointiuutiset](https://www.markkinointiuutiset.fi/artikkelit/suomalainen-markkinoijille-suunnattu-tekoaly-startup-hamuaa-vauhdilla-globaaleille-markkinoille).

- Among the first teams in the Nordics to gain access to OpenAI's GPT-3 in 2020, well before most realized how transformative AI would become. An AI-native developer long before "vibe coding" was a thing.

- Superlines platform utilizes over 100 individual AI agents to produce analysis and insights, with full API and MCP support.

- Previously Growth Lead at [Cronvall](https://www.cronvall.com), growth marketer at Slush 100 winner [Yousician](https://www.yousician.com), and Senior Growth Hacker at [Avaus](https://www.avaus.com).

- Builder of experimental tech products like [AI Search Index](https://www.aisearchindex.com) (AI traffic analytics), [EmailMCP](https://emailmcp.co) (AI assistant on MCP), [ConsoleChat](https://consolechat.io) (underground chat in the browser console - went viral on HackerNews).

I've been obsessed with AI and algorithms my entire career. Marketing is one of the best fields to use AI: lots of data and complex problems, many of which are impossible for humans to solve.
