I'm a maker and a marketer who creates ideas and builds them.

I Co-Founded [Grew](https://grew.dev) after inventing the AI-based secure location detection system in 2020.

Before Grew, I spent the last 10 years working as a consultant at [Avaus](https://www.avaus.com) helping companies (B2B / B2C) do better results with growth hacking, marketing automation, data, marketing technology, and app marketing. 

Currently building [Grew AI](https://grew.ai) - an easy-to-use online tool that uses AI to predict which content will work the best.
